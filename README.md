The top 12 Interview Questions (Youtube):

1. DFS
2. BFS
3. Matching Brackets/Parantheses
4. Hash Tables / Hash Maps / Hash Sets
5. Dynamic Programming, Memoing, Caching
6. Variables - Manipulating Multiple Pointers e.g. Traversing a Linked List, Longest Palindromic String
7. Reversing a Linked List - or also Detecting a Cycle in a Linked List, Detecting Duplicates in a Linked List.
8. Sorting Fundamentals - Not necessarily how to implement but more of runtime complexity of each and how they fare against each other.
9. Recursion - Whiteboard Programming this is difficult
10. Custom Data Structures like suffix tree, heap, trie, linked list + hash map
11. Object Oriented Programming - Designing X
12. Binary Search - Very Fundamental, usually questions are hidden / not obvious
